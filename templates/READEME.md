# How to Contribute

Expanding the capabilities of this project is always welcome. To add new objects to generate or new restrictions to apply, the Command and Restriction classes can be subclassed, respectively. There is a template file for each class in this directory. It has everything set up, with instructions on where to put custom code to complete you implementations.
